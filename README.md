# Agent Based Model - Assignment 1 - GEOG5995M

This repository includes the necessary files to complete my submission to the first assessment in GEOG5995M. This 
assignment included creating an Agent Based Model of agents (Sheep) moving and eating around an environment, interacting
with each other.

This repository includes:
- **Final Agent Based Model** = Assignment_1.py
- **Agent class with functions** = agentframework.py

Both files need to be open when running the final Agent Based Model as the model calls on multiple functions form the *agentframework.py*
file. Such functions include making the agents move, eat and then stop when they are full and to interact with other individual agents
and share their food with their neighbour.
